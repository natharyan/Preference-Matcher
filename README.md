# Stable Roommate Matching

Stable roommate matching, also known as the "Stable Roommates Problem," is a classical problem in the field of combinatorial optimization and algorithmic game theory. The problem involves finding a stable and mutually satisfactory set of roommate assignments in a scenario where individuals have preferences for potential roommates.

This algorithm is a modification of the stable roommate matching algorithm for finding optimal pairs using n-dimensional arrays.

I have used my algorithm to find optimal pairs between people selecting a variety of poetry preferences.

For this algorithm to work accurately, in your form, your options for every question will have to be laid in a sequential order of preference (option a is closer to b than c)

I assume that using the sequential order of options, a person selecting options a,b,c,d would be a closer match with a,c,b,d than a,b,j,d
