# Stable Roommate Matching

Stable roommate matching, also known as the "Stable Roommates Problem," is a classical problem in the field of combinatorial optimization and algorithmic game theory. The problem involves finding a stable and mutually satisfactory set of roommate assignments in a scenario where individuals have preferences for potential roommates.

This algorithm is a modification of the stable roommate matching algorithm for finding optimal pairs using n-dimensional arrays.

I have used my algorithm to find optimal pairs between people selecting a variety of poetry preferences.
